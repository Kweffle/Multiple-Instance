## 🧭 How It Works
Roblox normally limits you to one running client at a time.  
This script deletes roblox's singleton handle on each running instance of it allowing you to run as many as your PC can 
handle really idk I haven't tested it's limit

Running multiple Roblox instances may violate Roblox’s TOS.
Use responsibly — I am not responsible for any bans, warnings, or account actions.

Some antivirus programs **may flag this tool as suspicious**. It's a FALSE Positive! It's due to the tool's need to manipulate process handles in order for it to allow multiple roblox instances. The source code is fully visible and auditable. You may need to add an exclusion in your antivirus.
